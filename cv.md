## Short description

My purpose is to become the developer. I am going to learn how to make web applications good functioning and enjoyable to use. As you **could** notice, some companies and organizations don't have their web resources that good as they are in their businesses. This is what makes their customers (and also me) inconvenient and waste the kind of experience of easy and stylish using something.

## Skills

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS; 
- Basic knowledge of Figma, Photoshop; 
- Git & GitHub;
- VS Code & Sublime Text.

## Coding example

Here's a task from [CodeWars.com](CodeWars.com): *Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.*

### Solution:

```
function noSpace(x){
  return x.split(' ').join('');
}
```

## My projects

I don't have much yet. That CV, basically, is my first real project with all the developer instruments: IDE, Markdown and Git.

## Education

I have graduated RSATU named after P.A.Solovyev in Rybinsk, Russia. My specialization is Electronics and Nanoelectronics. Currently, I continue studying in the university with Electric power industry and Electrical engineering.

## Languages

- Russian - native speaker;
- English - B1/B2.

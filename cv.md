Short:
My purpose is to become the developer. I am going to learn how to make web applications good functioning and enjoyable to use. As you could notice, some companies and organizations don't have their web resources that good as they are in their businesses. This is what makes their customers (and also me) inconvenient and waste the kind of experience of easy and stylish using something.
Skills:
I have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS; I worked in Figma to develop lite web-pages layouts; I know basic commands of Git; I worked in VS Code and Sublime Text to code
Coding example. Here's a simple task I needed to solve: I need to remove the spaces from a string. Here's how I solved it:

function noSpace(x){
  return x.split(' ').join('');
}
My projects:
I don't have much yet. That CV, basically, is my first real project with all the developer instruments: IDE, Markdown and Git.
Education:
I have graduated RSATU named after P.A.Solovyev in Rybinsk, Russia. My specialization is Electronics and Nanoelectronics. Currently, I continue studying in the university with Electric power industry and Electrical engineering.
Languages:
I speak fluently Russian. Also I have been learning English by myself and now I have B1 or B2 level according to few internet resources, but I have no ITELS or TOEFL sertificates. I can easily read and listen to English speach, write and speak on some basic topics with no dictionary.
